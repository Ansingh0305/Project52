    <h1 style="color: cyan;">My intro</h1>
    <p style="color: chartreuse;">Hey! There my name is Anant Singh, I live in Kanpur UttarPradesh and I have just entered into class 9th. But still it realy doesn't feel like I am really in 9th class as all the studies are going on online and we are not able to meet our friends and there is no more fun left in bunking classes. Sometimes i get irritated beacause of the whole time home or #stayathome thing and I think that coding, learning new languages, creating your own game and of course playing video games is a perfect escape from all the problems and thats why the day i got to know about whitehat i joined it and thats how i created the games that you saw on my portfolio page. </p>
